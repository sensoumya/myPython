Assumptions of a Linear Regression:
1. Linearity
2. Homoscedasticity
3. Multivariate normality
4. Independence of errors
5. Lack of multicollinearity


5 methods of building models:
1. All in
2. Backward elemination
3. Forward selection
4. Bidirectional elimination
5. Score comparison

Stepwise regression actually refers to
2. Backward elemination
3. Forward selection
4. Bidirectional elimination

but sometime only Bidirectional elimination is also meant

1. All in:
		- Prior knowledge that all the variables are true predictors
		- Incase all the variables have to be used (as per instructions)
		- Preparing for backward elimination

2. Backward Elimination
